# Workshop on "Online Teaching: Challenges and Opportunitites" 
## Organised by Department of Civil Engineering, Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana

Keeping in view that online teaching is new to everyone,
and one needs to learn while delivering, like an entrepreneur, 
a workshop on "Online Teaching: Challenges and Opportunitites" 
was organised by Department of Civil Engineering, 
Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana.
The prime objective of workshop was to share experience,difficulties encountered 
and any innovation done, with hope that sharing will benefit all others. 

Session started with Dr H.S. Rai's comment about the Engineering 
faculty not being trained for online as well as offline teaching as 
none has been qualified with a B.Ed or M.Ed degree.
But, due to exposure to our teachers or masters teaching us during our schooling,
we all have acquired skills and have started teaching in our own understood ways. 
He added that, lack of monitoring and inefficient feedback mechanism 
further hindered improvement in one's teaching skills. 
He further added that many of the faculty might have exposure of the same by 
attending certain online expert lectures and moreover, each one of us is 
experimenting and acquiring experience everyday. 

To make this workshop more effective, responses of participating teachers 
were invited via google form prior to going live where faculty was asked to 
report any problem faced during online teaching and related innovation done.
Limited responses were obtained in this regard. Most of the respondents reported 
frequent network issue often leading to breaking of voice as reported by students. 
Another issue reported by faculty was about unsatisfactory attendance of students.

Meanwhile during the session, network of the host was lost due to power failure 
and hence a discussion was held amongst faculty regarding couple of cases where 
indiscipline was caused by few students during an online class.

Once reconnected to the session, Dr Rai suggested to explore the ways of 
improving student's attendance, availability of back-up system incase of power failure, 
availability of fully charged laptop or other standby things to avoid unforeseen obstructions.

Following this, Dr Rai shared a sample of the screen shared by one of the teacher during online class.
The shared screen was a pdf of handwritten notes. Inputs were asked from participating faculties to comment issues
keeping in view the student's perpective in mind.To this, Prof Charanjeet Singh suggested that multiple coloured
pens may be used to highlight important points. Besides this, he suggested that a pointer/marker
or pen's tip may be used to focus on what is being discussed at a particular instant of time.
Furthermore, Prof. Charanjeet pointed out an issue of handwriting that might confuse or lead to
unclarity to students, especially as far as use of notations are concerned.

To this input by Prof Charanjeet Singh, Prof Savleen expressed that though she has been making notes
as suggested by him, even then neither she nor her student's are very much satisfied with this approach
of sharing notes incase of numerical based subject. Prof Savleen expressed her desire to teach through a 
writing/black board and reported issue of non-availability of classroom as her lecture starts at 8:00 am. 
She added that she has reported and requested the time table incharge to change her class's schedule
to a little later to which Dr Rai assured her that availability of a classroom at anytime should not be an issue.

Dr Rai, sharing his point of view on issue of handwriting said that if that is the problem, 
it would remain there irrespective of the fact that one is sharing handwritten notes or
using black board to write as far as online teaching is concerned. He suggested to opt 
for typing instead of manually preparing notes by writing and scanning the same.
He questioned the participants that why teachers mostly prefer to prepare hand written notes over typed? 
To this, Prof Yuvraj Singh, expressed his point of view that if he was a student, he would have preferred
that his teacher taught using handwritten notes or writing simultaneously during lecture as far as 
numerical subjects are concerned. He added that, to him, typed numericals would give a feel of nothing
different than sharing/displaying a book during lecture, which he would personally not like
as a student who wish to learn. Dr Rai further questioned Prof Yuvraj, would it be even incase
of poor handwriting of a teacher? Prof Yuvraj said, yes, if a student is concentrating,
he/she can always ask if something is not legible enough to understand. Dr Rai cited an 
example of encountering poor handwriting of students during evaulation of answer sheets by 
the evaluators and that it infact becomes nothing less than a headache. Prof Yuvraj, agreed.

Dr Rai, reported that one of the major disadvantage of teacher's sharing slides of notes
is due to usual tendency of accelerating the pace while reading out from notes. 
This often makes it diffiult for students to understand and grab. Managing and
delivering with an optimum speed can prove to be instrumental in making the 
teaching-learning process more effective. Prof Tanpreet suggested the use of tools 
like excel/spreedsheets for presenting numerical type problems over conventional presentation. 
Dr Rai, agreed and asked Prof Tanpreet to share an example with everyone where one can visibly
compare the two techniques of delivering. Dr Rai, further focussed that the point of this workshop
is not to impose or bound teachers to opt for a specific style or technique, 
but it is all about sharing experiences and learning for a better outcome.

Dr Rai also emphasised on the use of the screen space available wisely and effectively.
He suggessted that clear and big font size is vital for effective delivery. 
Besides discussing on the possibilities of improvement incase of sharing handwritten notes,
he also cited one example of a shared powerpoint presentation during online class which too had many flaws.
Incase of such presentations, where there is no handwriting issue, he reported several issues 
including inefficent use of screen area by not opting for full screen mode, too much of text on a single slide,
small font size, etc. He suggested that if text is important, opt for increasing number of slides which 
should never really be an issue. But too much text on a single slideand that too a smaller one should be a big NO.

Furthermore, Dr Rai pointed out the language issue as reported by some students in the chat box during online class.
He instructed to strictly teach in English instead of Punjabi or even Hindi, as suggested by authorities too.
Improper scanning of notes was also observed and should be taken care of.

Prof Mandeep asked about the effective way in which laboratory experiments may be conducted and recorded.
She suggested involving atleast two faculty members for this purpose. Prof Mandeep enquired if mobile 
phones may be used to record the experiments. Dr Rai said yes, and expected good quality videos and 
suggested to produce videos like the ones made for cookery tutorials.
Furthermore, Prof Mandeep expressed an issue of logging in for online class as a co-host being a 2nd teacher.
But similar problem wasn't faced by any other participating faculty members.
Dr Rai suggested her to post her issue on helpline (forum) where she can expect help incase of any such issue.

Prof Charanjeet suggested that there should be a gap between the classes of two batches as he encountered an act of
indiscipline by a student of a different semester when he took some extra time clearing doubts of students.
Dr Rai assured that such acts of indiscpline are totally unacceptable and a team is working on monitoring such
cases and action is being taken against such students.

Dr Rai concluded by suggesting the participating faculty to frequently report problems faced during online classes
and any innovations done. He proposed to have similar workshops on regular basis for a better and enriching teaching-learning experience.
