# Two day workshop on "Online Teaching: Challenges and Opportunitites" 
## Organised by Department of Civil Engineering, Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana

Keeping in view that online teaching is new to everyone,
and one needs to learn while delivering, like an entrepreneur, 
a two day workshop on "Online Teaching: Challenges and Opportunitites" 
has been organised by Department of Civil Engineering, 
Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana, from Spetember 09-10, 2020.
The prime objective of workshop is to share experience,difficulties encountered 
and any innovation done, with hope that sharing will benefit all others. 

Session on day 01 started with Dr H.S. Rai's comment about Engineering 
faculty not being trained for online as well as offline teaching as 
none has been qualified with a B.Ed or M.Ed degree.
But, due to exposure to our teacher's teaching us during our schooling,
we all have acquired skills and have started teaching in our own understood ways. 
He added that, lack of monitoring and inefficient feedback mechanism 
further hindered improvement in one's teaching skills. 
He further added that many of the faculty might have exposure of the same by 
attending certain lectures aand moreover, each one of us is experimenting and acquiring exprience everday. 

To make this workshop more effective, responses of participating teachers 
were invited via google form prior to going live where faculty was asked to report any problem faced 
during online teaching and related innovation done. Limited responses were obtained in this regard.
Most of the respondents reported frequent network issue leading to breaking of voice as reported by students. 
Another issue reported by faculty was about unsatisfactory attendance of students.

Meanwhile during the session, network of the host was lost due to power failure and hence a discussion was 
held amongst faculty regarding couple of cases where indiscipline was caused by few students during an online class.

Once reconnected to the session, Dr Rai suggested to explore the ways of improving student's attendance, availability of back-up
sytem incase of power failure, availability of fully charged laptop or other standby things to avoid unforeseen obstructions.
